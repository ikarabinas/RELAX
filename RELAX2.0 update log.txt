Inserted a targeted wICA artifact reduction method, which specifically addresses only the artifact periods or frequencies of the ICA artifact components

Inserted the option to include a delay spread in the MWF cleaning, and the option to set the delay period and delay spread for eye movements and muscle artifacts separately

Removed the "beta" suffix from the test functions, as we applied the test options in our new pre-print, which demonstrated their appropriateness.

Deleted the original functions that are now replaced by the functions that were previously designated as test (beta) functions.

Adjusted default extreme artifact rejection settings to be less stringent in alignment with our recent publication

Updated RELAX_filtbutter.m to enable users to select causal or acausal filtering.



Minor changes:

Updated the GUI so that it's easier to set the cleaning parameters, and includes the optimal approach by default

Inserted the following code into RELAX_excluding_extreme_values.m immediately after line 246 to prevent a bug when metrics were set to be calculated but no NoiseMask was computed:
epochedEEG.RELAXProcessing.Details.NoiseMaskFullLength=epochedEEG.RELAXProcessing.Details.NaNsForNonEvents;

Adjusted line 120 in RELAX_blinks_IQR_method.m to improve functionality for sample rates >1000Hz:
(round(BlinkMaxLatency(1,x)-400/RELAX_cfg.ms_per_sample)>0) && (round(BlinkMaxLatency(1,x)+400/RELAX_cfg.ms_per_sample))<size(EEG.data,2)

Adjusted line 44 in RELAX_horizontaleye.m to refer to the correct variable (was a copy/paste error previously):
if isfield(RELAX_cfg, 'HorizontalEyeMovementTimepointsTestWindow')==0 % 1.1.6 updated incorrect specification of this variable here.

Removed warning about high-pass filter settings above 0.5Hz in RELAX_SET_PARAMETERS_AND_RUN.m
(as both our recent results and Delorme's suggest high-pass filtering at 0.5Hz to 1Hz can be better for ERPs).

Moved the warning about high sample rates to after the optional downsampling setting in RELAX_Wrapper.m
